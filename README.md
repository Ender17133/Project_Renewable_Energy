# Sustainable Development and Renewable Energy consumption
## Author: Beibarys Nyussupov 

My research question is - "How does renewable energy consumption contribute to the sustainable development goals in healthcare and environmental areas in the African countries and to what extent the renewable energy is used worldwide?"

It is a topic of my personal interest because I am very into geospatial data analysis and I was always interested in global climate change and global warming. I will be very happy to analyze the effects of renewable energy on global warming and on such sustainable development goals as: decrease of greenhouse emits causing global warming, good health and well-being, access to electricity.

It is also an important topic for others as usage of clean energy to save the environment is a widely discussed topic and I believe that it will be efficient to analyze the usage of renewable energy worldwide and its effects on the environment and country development.

My main data source that I am focusing on is World Bank and I don't want to use any other sources to avoid loss of data.

For geography, renewable energy consumption percentage is insufficient in most of the developed countries, which will stop me from doing relevant and reliable conclusions from my analysis. I chose to narrow down my analysis to countries in Africa, as MOST of the countries in Africa have higher rates of renewable energy consumption than the rest of the world and so it will be more efficient for me to focus on Africa region.
